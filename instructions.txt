--- COMP557 in-class test 2 ---

Edit the three asm files according to the instructions below:

ict2/q1/Nand.asm
ict2/q2/Add3.asm
ict2/q3/multplusone.asm

Do not edit or create other files (generated files are OK to leave in place).

Use the Assembler and CPU Emulator in the ict2/tools directory to test your chips.

Once you have completed the three questions, compress the entire ict2 directory and submit it to Moodle.
To compress on Windows: right-click the folder, select 'Send to', and then select 'Compressed (zipped) folder'.
To compress on Mac: right-click the folder, select 'Compress "ict2"'.

Please submit 35 minutes after you start.
Students with ILPs should stick to the following times:
adding 25% is about 44 minutes,
adding 33% is about 47 minutes,
adding 50% is about 50 minutes.
In each case, I will allow a grace period.


--- ict2/q1/Nand.asm [4 marks] ---

Write an assembly program that takes the contents of memory cell 0 and memory cell 1, calculates bitwise Nand of these two numbers, and stores the result in memory cell 2.

Nand has inputs 'a','b', output 'out', and the following truth table:

|   a   |   b   |  out  |
|   0   |   0   |   0   |
|   0   |   1   |   0   |
|   1   |   0   |   0   |
|   1   |   1   |   1   |

The assembly language has A instructions that set the A register, like this:

@2

and it has C instructions that compute, write registers and/or memory, and then conditionally jump, like this:

MD = M-1; JLE

Nand.asm is already started for you: the two operands have been moved into memory cell 2 and the D register, and the A register is set to 2.


--- ict2/q2/Add3.asm [4 marks] ---

Add the numbers given in memory cells 0, 1 and 2 and record their sum in memory cell 3.


--- ict2/q3/square.asm [2 marks] ---

Square the number given in memory cell 0 and record it in memory cell 1.


--- How it is marked ---

Each program will be run against a hidden test script.
If the submitted program passes all tests then it is awarded full marks.
If not, it may get zero marks (make sure to test your programs!).
